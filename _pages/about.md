I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University. 
My research interests are Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory, with a particular focus on the theory of Anderson modules.
Outside of the university, I have been an advocate for developing the study of mathematics through the High School Math Olympiad in my hometown.
